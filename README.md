# RhythmDetection
RhythmDetection is an application which should detect salsa rhythm (1-2-3, 5-6-7) in an audio record.  The project consists of 

* desktop application - to investigate and try out various beat detection algorithms;
* mobile application - it should record sound, detect and visualize the beat.

## Current State
The project is currently cancelled.  My interest in salsa and bachata has waned before I was able to finish the project.  So the app stays unfinished, waiting for better times.
